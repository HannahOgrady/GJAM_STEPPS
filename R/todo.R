## Next steps:
## redo climate variables
## need rasterized version for plotting
## then make an id column to take out all na columns but be able to rejoin
## also redo the variability to be intraannual variability
## then try running gjam with residuals
## if that works we need to bootstrap
## make entire workflow into some nested functions
## load in mean and standard deviation
## draw samples from distribution
## run full workflow for each sample
## see if conclusions are robust to uncertainty??
